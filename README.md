# Student-Enrollment-Form-Using-JsonPowerDB
This is a micro project on integrating a simple web-form with JsonPowerDB. For the purpose of this project, I have created a simple &amp; interactive student enrollment form using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

* JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.
* JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.
* Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.
