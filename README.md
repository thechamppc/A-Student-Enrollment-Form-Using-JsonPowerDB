# Student-Enrollment-Form-Using-JsonPowerDB
This is a micro project on integrating a simple web-form with JsonPowerDB. For the purpose of this project, I have created a simple &amp; interactive student enrollment form using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

JSONPowerDB is a high performance, light weight, ajax enabled, serverless, simple to use, real-time database. It makes it easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming or scripting. There is also no need to install any kind of database.
